1. What design principles guided your improvements?

Clarity & Readability: I focused on improving readability by choosing larger fonts, proper line spacing, and sufficient color contrast for text.

Consistency: Applied consistent styles for buttons, headings, and navigation.

Simplicity: Reduced clutter by minimizing unnecessary elements.

Mobile-first design: Prioritized layouts that look good on small screens first.

2. How did you ensure responsiveness across devices?

Implemented flexbox/grid layouts that adjust dynamically.

Used relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed px.

Applied media queries to adjust font size, spacing, and element arrangement for different screen widths.

Tested design on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, laptop).

3. What trade-offs did you make between design and performance?

Reduced heavy animations for faster load times.

Optimized images by compressing them (slightly less visual quality, but much faster).

Limited use of external libraries to keep the site lightweight.

Chose cleaner, simpler UI components instead of visually complex ones to improve accessibility.

4. What was the most challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?

Challenge: Balancing good visual hierarchy with fast load times on mobile.

Approach:

Used lightweight CSS framework/custom styles instead of bulky UI libraries.

Prioritized loading essential elements first.

Iteratively tested on low-end devices to ensure performance.
