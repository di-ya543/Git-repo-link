1. What tone and style should the AI use when responding?

The AI should use a supportive, encouraging, and student-friendly tone.

It should avoid being overly technical or intimidating, instead simplifying explanations.

The style should be conversational yet instructional, like a mentor guiding rather than just correcting

2. How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?

The AI should highlight potential problem areas (e.g., wrong variable, logic error, missing import) instead of directly stating the fix.

It should provide clues or step-by-step debugging strategies so the student practices problem-solving.

The balance comes from explaining why something is wrong without simply rewriting the code.

3. How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?

Beginners:

Use simpler explanations.

Add more step-by-step debugging tips (like “try printing values inside the loop to see what happens”).

Offer hints about syntax basics (indentation, variable naming, etc.).


Advanced learners:

Focus on deeper issues (efficiency, edge cases, readability).

Encourage them to think about why the bug occurs instead of just where.

Ask probing questions to make them reflect on design choices.
